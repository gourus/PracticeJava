 * Find maximum possible stolen value from houses

 * There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it.
 * A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses 
 * because owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbor left and right side. 
 * 
 * 
 * What is the maximum stolen value?
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE: This solution also solves, "Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent" problem.
